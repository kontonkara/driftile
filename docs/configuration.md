# Configuration

Open **System Settings > Window Management > KWin Scripts** and configure Driftile.

## Window decorations

**Hide KWin borders and title bars on application windows** is enabled by default. It covers tiled, floating, dialog, transient, and utility windows. Panels, desktop surfaces, unmanaged windows, and windows that were already borderless keep their KWin state.

The option controls server-side KWin decorations. Client-side decorations and application toolbars are part of the application surface and may remain visible.

Disabling the option restores decorations that Driftile removed. Unloading the extension does the same. Changes apply on the next KWin reconfigure or Driftile reload.
